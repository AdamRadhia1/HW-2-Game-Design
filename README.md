For this project, I created a game called Ghost Runner, a Halloween-themed endless runner that mixes controlled randomness, collision detection, and responsive interaction on both desktop and mobile. I wanted the game to feel playful but also suspenseful, so I included a day-to-night sky cycle, a glowing ghost character, random rolling obstacles, and funny text bubbles coming from the neighborhood houses. The text bubbles also act as distractions, making the player focus and try not to get thrown off while dodging obstacles.
  Throughout the process, I researched p5.js class structure, timing functions, mobile browser behavior, and event-based sound triggers. I used the p5.js website, MDN documentation, and some tutorials to understand certain interactions. I also used AI as a tool at a few points — mainly to translate parts of my original Processing (PDE) code into p5.js syntax and to help me understand why audio doesn’t autoplay on iPhones. That’s how I learned that iOS requires user interaction before sound can play, which led to adding the “tap to start” mechanic on mobile.
  Some of the biggest challenges were getting the music to trigger properly during the countdown, stopping speech bubbles from overlapping in distracting ways, and making sure the pause feature froze gameplay instead of resetting visuals. There were also layout challenges with making sure houses, clouds, and stars didn’t drift into the road space. All of this required a lot of trial, debugging, and patience, but working through those details helped me understand interactive systems better, especially animation timing, state management, and how user input differs across devices. Overall, the project ended up teaching me how to build up a concept step-by-step while improving and refining the experience along the way.
