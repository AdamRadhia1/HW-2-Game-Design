For this project, I designed a game called "Ghost Runner", a Halloween-themed endless runner that explores controlled randomness, collision detection, and responsive interaction on desktop and mobile. My goal was to create a playful yet suspenseful experience, so I incorporated a day-to-night atmospheric cycle, a glowing ghost character, randomized obstacles (The circles/balls), and neighbor reactions in the form of text bubbles coming from the homes on the side of the road to bring the world to life.The text bubbles are also another layer of obstacle to test the users focus and determination to get past as many obstacles as possible without getting distracted. I researched p5.js class structure, mobile audio policies, and game-loop timing techniques to manage object spawning, state transitions, and sound behavior. One of my biggest challenges was enabling background music to begin at the correct time on mobile devices due to browser audio restrictions. This took an incredibly long time to figure out, and was finally able to work on mobile once I incorporated a "tap to start". The tap-to-start activates the audio context and fades in music during the countdown. Additional obstacles included stopping speech bubbles from overlapping the road area, maintaining pause state visuals, and ensuring the homes, clouds, and stars did not overlap the looping road â€” all of which required contstant debugging and layout logic adjustments. Overall, this project deepened my understanding of interactive media systems, animation timing, user experience on mobile/desktop, and the importance of building the small details when you start  off with a general idea.
